# Workflow Logic Improvements: User-Analyst Collaboration

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Workflow Issues
1. **Limited Communication**: Only basic notifications when reviews start
2. **No Real-time Updates**: Users can't see progress or communicate during review
3. **Minimal Collaboration**: No way for analysts to ask questions or users to provide clarifications
4. **Static Assignment**: No dynamic assignment based on expertise or workload
5. **Poor Visibility**: Users can't track detailed progress or provide additional context

## Enhanced Workflow Design

### 1. Real-time Communication System

#### Features to Implement:
- **In-app Messaging**: Direct communication between users and analysts
- **Threaded Comments**: Comments on specific questions/findings
- **Smart Notifications**: Real-time updates via WebSocket + email
- **File Sharing**: Collaborative document review and sharing

#### Technical Implementation:
```python
# WebSocket-based real-time communication
class WorkflowNotificationService:
    def notify_status_change(self, application_id, new_status, user_id):
        # Real-time notification to user
        pass
    
    def notify_clarification_request(self, application_id, question_id, analyst_id):
        # Notify user of clarification needed
        pass
    
    def notify_progress_update(self, application_id, progress_percentage):
        # Update progress bar in real-time
        pass
```

### 2. Collaborative Review Process

#### Enhanced Status Flow:
```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → ASSIGNED → IN_REVIEW → CLARIFICATION_NEEDED → IN_REVIEW → COMPLETED
                ↓                    ↓                    ↓
            AUTO-ASSIGN         PROGRESS_TRACKING    USER_RESPONSE
```

#### Key Improvements:
1. **Dynamic Assignment**: Auto-assign based on analyst expertise and workload
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with detailed milestones
3. **Clarification Loop**: Analysts can request clarifications, users can respond
4. **Collaborative Findings**: Joint resolution of security findings

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

#### User Dashboard Enhancements:
- **Live Activity Feed**: Real-time updates on review progress
- **Progress Visualization**: Detailed progress bars and timelines
- **Collaboration History**: Complete audit trail of interactions
- **Document Management**: Version control and collaborative editing

#### Analyst Dashboard Enhancements:
- **Workload Management**: Queue prioritization and load balancing
- **Expertise Matching**: Auto-assignment based on technology stack
- **Collaboration Tools**: Direct communication with users
- **Progress Analytics**: Review efficiency and quality metrics

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Enhanced notifications table
CREATE TABLE workflow_notifications (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    application_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    from_user_id TEXT,
    to_user_id TEXT,
    notification_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    metadata TEXT, -- JSON data
    read_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (application_id) REFERENCES applications (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (from_user_id) REFERENCES users (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (to_user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

-- Collaboration comments
CREATE TABLE collaboration_comments (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    application_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    question_id TEXT,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    comment TEXT NOT NULL,
    parent_comment_id TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (application_id) REFERENCES applications (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_comment_id) REFERENCES collaboration_comments (id)
);

-- Progress tracking
CREATE TABLE review_progress (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    application_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    review_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    milestone TEXT NOT NULL,
    progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (application_id) REFERENCES applications (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (review_id) REFERENCES security_reviews (id)
);
```

### API Endpoints
```python
