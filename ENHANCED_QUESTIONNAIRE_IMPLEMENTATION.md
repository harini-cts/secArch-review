### 2. Enhanced Database Schema

#### New Columns Added to Applications Table:
```sql
-- Enhanced technology stack fields
application_type TEXT DEFAULT ""
frontend_tech TEXT DEFAULT ""
backend_tech TEXT DEFAULT ""
backend_frameworks TEXT DEFAULT ""
container_tech TEXT DEFAULT ""

-- Security context fields
data_types TEXT DEFAULT ""
compliance TEXT DEFAULT ""
risk_tolerance TEXT DEFAULT ""
business_impact TEXT DEFAULT ""

-- Third-party services
auth_services TEXT DEFAULT ""
payment_services TEXT DEFAULT ""
comm_services TEXT DEFAULT ""
analytics_services TEXT DEFAULT ""
```

### 3. Intelligent Review Determination Logic

#### New `determine_required_reviews()` Function:
The system now intelligently determines which security reviews are required based on comprehensive application data:

- **Application Review**: Always required
- **Cloud Review**: Required when cloud services are used
- **Database Review**: Required when databases are used
- **Infrastructure Review**: Required for containerized/microservice applications
- **Compliance Review**: Required when compliance standards are specified
- **API Review**: Required for API services and third-party integrations

#### Review Determination Criteria:

**Cloud Review Triggers:**
- Cloud providers selected (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Serverless application type
- Cloud-based authentication services
- Cloud-based communication services

**Database Review Triggers:**
- Database types selected (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Database technologies in backend stack
- Explicit database review requirement

**Infrastructure Review Triggers:**
- Container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Service mesh technologies (Istio, Linkerd)
- Microservice architecture
- Production/hybrid deployment environments

**Compliance Review Triggers:**
- Compliance standards selected (SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, etc.)
- Sensitive data types (PII, PHI, Financial)
- High risk tolerance or business impact

**API Review Triggers:**
- API service or microservice application type
- Authentication services (OAuth, SAML, etc.)
- Payment services integration
- Third-party service integrations

### 4. Enhanced Form Processing

#### Updated Form Data Handling:
- Captures all new technology stack selections
- Processes security context information
- Handles third-party service selections
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data

#### Database Integration:
- Updated INSERT statements to include all new fields
- Proper data validation and sanitization
- Maintains referential integrity
